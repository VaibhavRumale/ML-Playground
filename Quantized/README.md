# Quantized MNIST Model with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to implement quantization on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. 
Quantization reduces the model size and improves inference efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. 
The repository includes scripts for training the model (`train.py`), quantizing it, and running inference (`inference.py`). The quantized model achieves an accuracy of 98.49% on the MNIST test set. 

 To get started, install the dependencies, 

* run `train.py` to train and quantize the model,  
 
* use `inference.py` to evaluate its performance.
